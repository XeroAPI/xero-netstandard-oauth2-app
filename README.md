# Xero NetStandard OAuth 2.0 Starter App
This is a companion app built with .NET Core 3.1 MVC to demonstrate Xero OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication & OAuth 2.0 APIs.

__IMPORTANT!__ This application is for demo only. We recommend setting up a secure token storage for your production app.

Its functions include:

- connect & reconnect to Xero
- storing Xero token in a .json file
- refresh Xero access token on expiry
- allow user to switch between tenants/organisations
- allow user to disconnect a tenant or revoke token
- allow manual testing of many Xero API endpoints
- display API call responses
- display code snippets responsible for the call

You can connect this companion app to an actual Xero organisation and make real API calls. Please use your Demo Company organisation for your testing. [Here](https://central.xero.com/s/article/Use-the-demo-company) is how to turn it on. 

### Create a Xero app
You will need your Xero app credentials created to run this demo app.

To obtain your API keys, follow these steps:

* Create a [free Xero user account](https://www.xero.com/us/signup/api/) (if you don't have one)
* Login to [Xero developer center](https://developer.xero.com/myapps)
* Click "New App" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url.
* Enter the redirect URI (your callback url - i.e. `https://localhost:5001/Authorization/Callback`)
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Click "Generate a secret" button.
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. You secret is now hidden.

### Download the code
Clone this repo to your local drive or open with GitHub desktop client.

### Configure your API Keys
In /NetStandardApp/appsettings.json, you should populate your XeroConfiguration as such: 

```
  "XeroConfiguration": {
    "ClientId": "YOUR_XERO_APP_CLIENT_ID",
    "ClientSecret": "YOUR_XERO_APP_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "CallbackUri": "https://localhost:5001/Authorization/Callback",
    "Scope": "openid offline_access profile ... ",
    "State": "YOUR_STATE"
  }
```

Note that you will have to have a state. The CallbackUri has to be exactly the same as redirect URI you put in Xero developer portal letter by letter. 

Note that if Bankfeed and/or Finance API(s) is/are used with the example code, you must contact Xero via https://www.xero.com/uk/partner-programs/financialweb/contact/ for access request.
If not, then just remove the finance API scopes from Scope variable in the json file.

- passes a boolean firstTimeConnection to view to control the display of buttons. 

**AuthorizationController**

Xero token is stored in a JSON file in the root of the project "./xerotoken.json". The app serialise and deserialise with the static class functions in /Utilities/TokenUtilities.cs. Most controllers will get and refresh token before calling API methods.

## Cross Site Forgery Attack Example
For demonstrating OAuth 2.0 [CSFR](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/state-parameters) implementation, two static methods were created to handle local storage of current state (state.json): TokenUtilities.StoreState(string state) and TokenUtilities.GetCurrentState(). 

In AuthenticationController, on construction it generates a random GUID string as state. The Index() will store the state to state.json, then be retrieved on Callback(). If state does not match, the controller returns a warning "Cross site forgery attack detected!" instead of carrying forward the token request flow.
